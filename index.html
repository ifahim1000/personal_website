           <h2>Hi ! I am Iftekhar Fahim.</h2>
           <p>I am 22.I am from Comilla, Bangladesh. I am currently pursuing study in Computer Sceince and Engineering.I didn't know much about    the usages of computer in my early days but here I am. I am simple and love to keep things simple.<br>
            Two of my favourite quotes:<br>
            <span id="qut-design">"Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new."</span> So, I like to try and learn new things.<br>
            <span id="qut-design">"Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value."</span>- I admire those people and want to see myself in that position One-day.
